# Complexion-Evolver



This repository contains the source files for parsing and extracting the geometrical dataset -vertices, edges, faces, cells - from a voronoi tesselation of a 3-dimensional space. The latter is obtained from an open-source software , voro

Among the list of files provided, the logical sequence is the following : Sort.c takes in random_points_v.gnu as input and generates NewGenerator3D.fe. Sort.c also generates auxillary files such as vertex_list.txt, etc., for individual examination of geometrical features.
